  With an awesome partner, I delivered a website of tools and guidance for local
  councils considering publishing open data. It covers the journey from "what"
  and "why" to "how do I convince the management" through to specific tools for
  publishing data and policy templates. It built on my previous work on the Open
  Council Data Standards (started as a hobby project) and the Open Council Data
  Map, polishing them up and combining them into a more comprehensive platform.
