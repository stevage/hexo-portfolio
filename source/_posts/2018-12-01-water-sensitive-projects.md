Built for a collaborative research centre, this site allows users to explore green infrastructure and water treatment projects planned and developed around the city of Kunshan in China. It combines a map with several layers, plus "glossy brochure"-style information in a side panel.

One of the challenges of the project was developing a way to collaborate with the team, who had low familiarity with geospatial tools. We used uMap as the shared geospatial platform, and Google Drive with a fixed directory structure for sharing site content.
