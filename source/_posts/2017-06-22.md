The **3D Development Activity Model** is a tool for communicating the major building projects (especially skyscrapers) planned or underway, across the City of Melbourne. Simple to grasp, it turns complex planning documents into the right level of understanding for most people: "There will be a huge apartment building here, with construction starting next year". The launch was fairly high profile, with several news articles appearing about it.

**My role:**  Suggested Mapbox-GL-JS as platform and developed the initial prototype. (Not the interactivity, help dialogs etc.)
