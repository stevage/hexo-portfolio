Wikitext, the markup language in which Wikipedia is written, is notoriously hard to parse, and is poorly defined. I embarked on the fool's errand of writing a formal grammar, in [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/), a Java-based tool which generates parsers from grammars. The parser was able to handle approximately 90% of existing pages. Which, in real world terms, is completely useless.

It is preserved [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Markup_spec/ANTLR/draft).
