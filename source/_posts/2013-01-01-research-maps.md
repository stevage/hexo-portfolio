description: >-
  Over the course of several years I taught around 20 mapping workshops,
  creating and refining material using a very hands-on methodology of "try to
  replicate this output". To support the workshops I spun up a number of server
  instances, encouraging participants to work together as a table, one per
  server. <br><br>The content is available at <a
